TRIVIA GAME

I have created a Trivia game about baseball using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. This is how this game works:


1. The game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

2. If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a 
   few seconds, display the next question.

3. The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, the correct answer is displayed with a video related to the answer. A continue button has
    been created so the player can watch the video is desired, and the then click the this button so the next question is displayed.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, the correct answer is displayed with a video. A continue button has been added as explained
    in the above item.

4. On the final screen, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game are displayed.
